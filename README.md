# RBCA Backend

## Description
RBCA Backend is a robust backend system for role-based access control (RBAC) in Node.js applications. It uses Express.js for the server and Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling. This system allows for efficient management of users, roles, and permissions.

## Features
- User authentication (login and registration)
- Role management
- Permission management
- Middleware for route protection based on authentication
- Custom validation utilities
- Error handling
